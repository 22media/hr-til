# HR-TIL

Welcome to the Hashrocket 'Today I Learned' repository.

TIL is a project by Hashrocket to catalogue the sharing & accumulation of knowledge as it happens day-to-day. Posts have a 200-word limit and any Hashrocket team member can contribute.

This site was open sourced as a window into our development process, as well as to allow people to experiment with the site on their own and contribute the project.

### Install

If you are creating your own version of the site, fork the repository. For everybody else, follow these setup steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/hr-til
cd hr-til
rake db:setup
cp config/application.yml{.example,}
cp config/secrets.yml{.example,}
rails s
```


Authentication is managed by Omniauth and Google. Visit '/admin' and log in with your email address.

### Hosting

Staging and production for Hashrocket's TIL is located here:

* http://hr-til-staging.herokuapp.com
* http://til.hashrocket.com

### Environmental Variables

These environmental variables are needed in development for some features to work:

```
host: 'http://localhost:3000'
google_client_id:
google_client_secret:
slack_post_endpoint:
update_twitter_with_post: 'false'
twitter_consumer_key:
twitter_consumer_secret:
twitter_access_token:
twitter_access_token_secret:
secret_key_base:
heroku_production_app_name:

And this variable toggles basic auth:

```

```
