Welcome to the Hashrocket 'Today I Learned' repository.

> TIL is a project by Hashrocket to catalogue the sharing & accumulation of
> knowledge as it happens day-to-day. Posts have a 200-word limit and any
> Hashrocket team member can contribute.

This site was open sourced as a window into our development process, as well as
to allow people to experiment with the site on their own and contribute the
project.

### Install

If you are creating your own version of the site, fork the repository. Then,
follow these setup steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/hr-til
$ cd hr-til
$ bundle install
$ rake db:setup
$ cp config/application.yml{,.example}
$ rails s
```

Authentication is managed by Omniauth and Google. Once you've set up an app in
the Google Developer's Console API manager, change `hashrocket.com` in the code
below to the domain of users you're allowing to post:

```ruby
# config/initializers/omniauth.rb

Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :google_oauth2,
    ...
    hd: 'hashrocket.com',
    ...
end
```

With this in place, you can visit '/admin' and log in with an email address from
the domain you've allowed.

### Hosting
